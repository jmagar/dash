# Cascade Implementation Guide - DTO Migration Project

## Overview
As Cascade, I will implement Phase 1 of the DTO migration project using my built-in capabilities:
- Code search and analysis
- File viewing and modification
- Command execution
- Progress tracking

## Document Structure
1. `README.md`: Project overview and quality standards
2. `phase1-standardization.md`: Technical requirements
3. `phase1-implementation-guide.md`: Step-by-step process
4. This file: Implementation approach

## Implementation Approach

### 1. Analysis Phase
Using `codebase_search` and `grep_search`:
- Map all DTO locations
- Identify usage patterns
- Find dependencies
- Detect potential breaking changes

### 2. Implementation Process
Using `edit_file` and `write_to_file`:
- Make atomic changes
- Update types systematically
- Maintain documentation
- Create new type definitions

### 3. Verification Steps
Using `run_command`:
```bash
# Type checking
npm run type-check

# Tests
npm run test

# Coverage
npm run type-coverage
```

## Progress Tracking Format
```markdown
## Implementation Status: [Step X]

### Completed Actions
- [List of specific changes made]
- Files modified: [file paths]
- Types affected: [type names]

### Verification Results
- Type Coverage: XX%
- Test Results: [Details]
- Breaking Changes: [List]

### Next Actions
- [Specific next steps]
- [Any blockers or concerns]
```

## Quality Standards
- Type Safety: 98% coverage
- Performance: Build <10%, Runtime <3%
- Testing: Unit >95%, Integration >90%

## Tool Usage

### Code Analysis
```typescript
// Search patterns
codebase_search:
- "interface *DTO"
- "type *DTO"
- "class *DTO"

grep_search:
- "export (interface|type|class) .*DTO"
```

### File Operations
- View files before modification
- Make atomic edits
- Verify after changes
- Track related files

### Command Execution
- Run verification after each change
- Execute tests for affected areas
- Monitor performance metrics

## Communication
I will:
- Report progress after each step
- Flag any issues immediately
- Provide specific metrics
- Suggest optimizations when found

## Implementation Priority
1. Core types with high usage
2. Dependent type chains
3. Isolated types
4. Documentation and cleanup
