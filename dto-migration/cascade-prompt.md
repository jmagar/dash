## DTO Migration Implementation

You are tasked with implementing our DTO migration strategy. The implementation plan is detailed in these files:

- [cascade-implementation.md](cascade-implementation.md) contains your exact implementation steps
- [phase1-implementation-guide.md](phase1-implementation-guide.md) details Phase 1 requirements
- [phase1-standardization.md](phase1-standardization.md) defines our technical standards
- [README.md](README.md) provides project context

Follow cascade-implementation.md exactly. Execute each step as written. Do not skip steps or deviate from the plan.
