# Instructions for Cline - DTO Migration Project

## Your Task
You are tasked with implementing Phase 1 of a DTO migration project for a TypeScript codebase. You have three key documents to guide you:

1. `README.md`: Your starting point and overview
2. `phase1-standardization.md`: Your requirements specification
3. `phase1-implementation-guide.md`: Your step-by-step guide

## How to Use These Documents

### Start Here
1. Read `README.md` first
   - Understand project scope
   - Note quality standards
   - Review phase overview

2. Before Each Step
   - Check requirements in phase1-standardization.md
   - Follow process in phase1-implementation-guide.md
   - Create checkpoints as specified

### Working Process
1. Analysis
   - Document current state
   - List affected types
   - Identify dependencies

2. Implementation
   - Follow steps exactly
   - Document all changes
   - Maintain quality standards

3. Verification
   - Check type coverage
   - Run tests
   - Verify documentation

## Important Notes
- Create checkpoints after each step
- Document all decisions
- Flag any uncertainties
- Follow type safety requirements strictly

## Expected Output Format
For each step:
```markdown
## Step X: [Name]
Status: [In Progress/Complete]

### Changes Made
- [List of changes]

### Verification
- Type Coverage: XX%
- Tests: [Pass/Fail]
- Documentation: [Updated/Needed]

### Next Steps
- [List next actions]
```

## Quality Requirements Summary
- Type Safety: 98% coverage, strict mode
- Performance: Build <10%, Runtime <3%
- Testing: Unit >95%, Integration >90%
- Documentation: Complete and current

## Communication Guidelines
1. When Stuck
   - Clearly state the issue
   - Show relevant code/types
   - List attempted solutions
   - Ask specific questions

2. When Completing Steps
   - Use output format above
   - Include all metrics
   - Document any deviations
   - List next actions

3. When Finding Issues
   - Document the problem
   - Assess impact
   - Propose solutions
   - Wait for confirmation

Remember: Follow the implementation guide step by step, maintain quality standards, and document everything thoroughly.
