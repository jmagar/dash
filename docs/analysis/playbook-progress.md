## Next Steps
1. Complete Phase 0:
   - Run git commands to get complete file listing
   - Create detailed categorization matrix
   - Document ignored files and build artifacts

2. Fill gaps in Component Analysis:
   - Complete dependency mapping
   - Document data flow patterns
   - Analyze state management

3. Continue Pattern Analysis:
   - Identify code duplication
   - Document performance patterns
   - Analyze error handling

4. Begin Integration Analysis:
   - Map API integration points
   - Document service dependencies
   - Create data flow diagrams
