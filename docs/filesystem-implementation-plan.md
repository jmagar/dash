# File Explorer Implementation Plan

## Core Objectives
1. Create a deeply integrated file management system that works across the entire application
2. Support multiple protocols (SFTP, SMB, WebDAV, Rclone) with seamless switching
3. Enable dual-pane view for easy file transfers
4. Integrate with all app features (remote execution, backups, etc.)
5. Create virtual spaces for grouping files from different sources
6. Maintain consistent Material UI design
7. Optimize navigation for quick access to any location
