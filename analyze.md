I need you to systematically and thoroughly analyze and investigate all project files.

You are to properly, effectively, and efficiently identify the most critical issues and areas that will prevent the project from building, launching, or running properly.

Once you have identified the most critical areas, investigate the source of the problems and devise the most efficient way to fix the issues, be sure to take your time, and investigate all possible avenues and possibilities and use best practices whilst developing a strategy to finally get this project operational.

The goal is to get the project operational, I've been working on it for a while now but have never actually been able to get it running, so your main goal is to devise a way to get a minimal version of the project running with ONLY the essentials running, then slowly add our features back in so that we can debug each one seperately.

Develop a comprehensive/highly detailed plan in markdown file(s) to achieve our goal.

TO BEGIN:

Open @src_structure.txt, and systematically analyze all files in the tree view of @src_structure.txt marking your progress as you go.

You are to be VERY DETAIL ORIENTED WHEN YOU DO YOUR ANALYSIS. YOU ARE TO ANALYZE ALL FILES BEFORE YOU DO ANYTHING.

Take notes of all your findings in a seperate file.

Some things you should check for but NOT limited to:
Proper alignment of all project code between client/server/agent.
Any code duplication.
Incomplete/TODO/stub/placeholder code.
Proper project structure.
Missing logic.
Inconsistent, inefficient, insecure code.
Missing features.
All required dependencies installed/configured properly.
Anything else that will negatively impact the project.

The only things you should be doing when you are analyzing the files is to check for the things I've listed above, making notes of any findings, and marking progress. You will do NOTHING besides that until you've check and analyzed ALL of the files in @src_structure.txt.

Your loop is to be:
-Check @src_structure.txt to see what file is next
-Check the file
-Make notes of any findings
-Mark progress
-Repeat until all files are checked and analyzed
